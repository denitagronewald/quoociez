A massive amount of fixes, changes, additions and more have been collected since our last Mainline (The Profit-Taker) and splayed below for you! Sometimes WIP features slip through the cracks and launch. Hi. My name's kinchtheknifeblade on the wiki. From the beginning, I'd like to make a few things clear here. I wrote these pieces, but it'd be too easy to just tell you why I wrote it. So, along with the parts where I just point out little easter eggs and connections to prior Gamers Against Weed works, I am going to be making an argument here.

# Intro: Who Is Barbie? Understanding The Doll (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hhjjhYGQtY) I am, and have always been, a vocal Barbie apologist. When I was in high school I had a crush on a boy in my technical theatre class (at least I think I did, it was a weird time for me) and he invited me over to his family’s gym for his birthday and when I got there his little brother greeted me and then handed me an essay that he had printed out about how Barbie was terrible for society. Hello my dear friends, today I am going to impart on you knowledge handed down by those who have sold out their souls from the Zelda community, the sellouts™ and truthers™, and have turned on the Historia and the Encyclopedia to force their views on the canon down your throat. This is a follow-up to this thread from two weeks ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/aev2jb/the_curious_case_of_the_history_of_the_zelda/), detailing our view on the Zelda timeline. All kidding aside My thoughts on Ace Combat 4. (https://www.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/9lb2xq/so_i_decided_to_play_this_holy_trinity_you_guys/) My thoughts on Ace Combat Zero.

I’ve got a lot to say about this one so strap in. ampnbsp; ampnbsp; ampnbsp; The Setup: Again I played on my PC with PCSX2. This is the last post for my "Changes to 'class' Arsenal" series. Unlike my previous post, you don't have to go to a google doc's in order to look at the changes. Every change is listed in this post, with a accompanying short description providing the reasons behind the re-balance/rework. If you find a change to your disliking, want to provide critique for why a certain change does/doesn't work, or you just wish to say hi, then please comment below. I will attempt to reply to every comment. #RESPECT HAN JIHAN, THE GAMER (https://i.imgur.com/cmbj4Mq.png) --- ## Summary Han Jihan was a normal (if game-addicted) student, living his life, when one day he awoke to discover that he could interact with the world as if it was a game (https://i.imgur.com/4Dr0g9T.png) through a strange power called "The Gamer". This means he can see his stats (https://i.imgur.com/PHo71r2.png), get quests (https://i.imgur.com/cH8k7oj.png), level up (https://i.imgur.com/hUdw2uB.png), and do countles. --------------- #Complete Elementalist and Traits Overhaul --------------- While my design approach for this revamp was all about the concept of fun gameplay and more build diversity. I am in no means an expert in balancing, all of these are suggestions and concepts in the hope that it may inspire others. If some of the numbers seem too strong or weak, keep in mind the focus was meant on the concept, not the numbers itself, the numbers can easily be adjusted. Some of you may already So, the purpose of this post is to highlight all of the gaps in the Ark Tech Trees and hopefully get said gaps addressed either in the game's current incarnation or in any potential sequel. There are dozens of items that are missing equivalents in one or more of the four tiers and though there are a lot of logical omissions, there are also a lot of gaps that are just awkward . I've codified and color-coded almost all of them, and if there's anything you want addressed - Weapons that come from God Wars Dungeon 2 are all considered Tier 85, but they don't do as much damage as it seems. These weapons actually have Tier 80 damage and Tier 90 accuracy, therefore, for general slayer, weapons with higher tiers of damage are usually better since you almost always have 100% accuracy during slayer task due to the huge accuracy bonus of having a slayer helmet equipped. The weapons I'm talking about include: Dragon Rider Lance, Shadow Glaives, Twin furry blades

About a year ago, I made a huge list (https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/6egtvw/my_ultimate_android_games_recommendations_review/) of Android games that I personally recommend. Now, I'm going to expand and improve upon the list! Here's my ultimate recommendations list, version 2! Note: games on this list aren't numbered. I love them all equally. ## Leap Day Free (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.leapday) Leap Day is a one-touch. # Chapter 32 First (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6oqstg/oc_the_magineer_chapter_1/) Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/898rln/the_magineer_chapter_31/) Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/voodooattack?)

Idea: Valyrian steel, both weapons and armor, somehow acts as a mind or consciousness . Allowing that will resolve GRRM’s inclinations to mind-control in a creatively new way. Let me explain: Suppose Little Robbin or somebody else is mind-controlling person A and person A commits act X. Then the moral responsibility for X ultimately is on Little Robbin. The narrative issue with mind-control is that it is simply postponing the question of responsibility. Things are quite different So, I have absolutely 0 ability to (or time/inclination to get the ability) to actually make a game. Let alone one like this. But I like to come up with game concepts as a way to relax, and for some reason felt like posting this one somewhere. This is really an amalgamation of dozens of ideas about 4X games that I've had over the years. So, here it goes: # RACE FOR THE STARS # Game Start (Empire Selection) The fundamental idea comes from playing 4X games and Grand Strategy games, which For Vampire Coast, it’s clear the coves will get fixed in some way later on, either removing the messages about the cooldown entirely or actually reimplementing some type of cooldown in a limited way. Not sure what I’d prefer. Need to play more to decide just how essential the hero action is to the economy. I was overflowing with money in Vortex and stopped placing Coves after a while as I found treasure maps more fun. I also haven’t checked if they affect diplomacy. I kind of assumed I could. A list of Origami designs with special magical effects— FINISHED ! My heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed!!! I introduced it to my campaign as a reward for an adventure in a Demiplane of Paper, the premise being a powerful witch either created or collected these designs in books that have a limited set of enchanted papers keyed to their respective designs, giving the GM some latitude about how many figures their players could create. More complex designs would require practi. As with many things in Final Fantasy XIV, the Omega raids borrow heavily from other Final Fantasy games for content and references. Sigmascape is particularly full of references to Final Fantasy VI, with the scenarios, mechanics, and ability names for the four fights pulling from fights with the same enemies in that game. As such, I thought it'd be fun to go over the four fights and talk about where the various references came from. --------- Sigmascape 1.0: Boss: Phantom Train In Final. </p>
