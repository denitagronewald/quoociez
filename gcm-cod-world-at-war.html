                            <p> German Gary Oldman yelling at me to keep killing the Frenchies sound pretty nutty. I can't remember the name of this YouTuber for the life of me and I wanted to look him up again. All I vaguely remember is he was pretty vulgar in his videos and used the song "Fuck The Pain Away" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG89dp9Z_gM) in either his intro or outro to his videos. Does anyone have any idea who I'm referring to? Maybe his name was Shadow? That rings a bell, but I can't find his channel still.
